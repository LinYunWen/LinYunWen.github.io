# Tips on Google Search

## tips
### Use quotations to search for the exact order
- When searching for something specific, try using quotes to minimize the guesswork for Google search
- exactly match
- e.g.
    - Puppy Dog Sweaters
    - “Puppy Dog Sweaters”
### Use a hyphen to exclude words
- 使用減號去除某些特定詞彙
- e.g.
    - Mustang -cars
<!--more-->
### Use +
- You do this with the + operator, in front of the otherwise excluded word

### Use ~
- Similar Results
- ~ (Tilde): putting the ‘~’ symbol before a word tells the search engine that you are looking for words _similar_ to the one you entered. So if you were shopping for a used ‘car’, but also might be interested in a ‘pre-owned van’ or a ‘secondhand vehicle’, a good search term to use would be ‘~used ~cars’.

### Use : 
- site:
    - e.g.
        - Sidney Crosby site:nhl.com
- related:
    - Find sites that are similar to other sites
    - e.g.
        - related:amazon.com
- filetype:
    - e.g.
        - filetype:pdf
- allintitle:
    - to look for words in the webpage title
    - e.g.
        - allintitle: Google is faster than Bing.
### Use the asterisk wildcard
- e.g.
    - “Come * right now * me”


### Search for multiple words at once
- e.g.
    - chocolate OR white chocolate
    - “Best ways to prepare for a job interview” OR “How to prepare for a job interview”

### Search a range of numbers
- e.g.
    - What teams have won the Stanley Cup ..2004
    - 41..43

## How do you search for special characters?
- you must escape the special character by adding a backslash before it
    - e.g.
        - To search for the string “where?”, escape the question mark as follows: “where\?”
- It's very easy to search for the string "##" in the bash documentation: Just run "info bash", hit "s", and enter "##" as the search string.
